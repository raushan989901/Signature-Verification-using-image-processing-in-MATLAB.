# Signature-Verification-using-image-processing-in-MATLAB.
This MATLAB project focuses on verifying the authenticity of a signature by comparing two images: the reference signature and the test signature. The system utilizes feature detection algorithms (Harris and SURF) to extract and match distinguishing characteristics of the signatures, enabling verification.
